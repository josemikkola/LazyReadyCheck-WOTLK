Lazy Ready Check accepts ready checks for you

After the raid leader sends out a ready check, between one and five seconds you will accept the ready check!
It is very simple, all you need to do is the following:

```
/lrc on
```
After relogging readychecks will act like normal - you will have to drag your mouse all the way over to the accept button and click it. The horror.

But... but.. my raid leader shouted at me for accepting the ready check even though I was making coffee/petting cat/peeing!
Fine, do the following:

```
/lrc off
```
